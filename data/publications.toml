This study shows that when considered on an infinite grid, certain combinations of local rules can achieve global tasks that were impossible on finite grids.

The classical formulation asks for a one-dimensional cellular automaton that, for any odd-length cyclic binary configuration, converges to all-0 if the number of 1s is even or to all-1 if the number of 1s is odd:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. The only known solution (“BFO rule”) was later found to fail on certain configurations. In this paper, we present a corrected single-rule solution to the parity problem along with a complete proof of its correctness:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}. Our result demonstrates that cellular automata *can* reliably solve the global parity task, resolving an open problem by providing a fully validated rule that achieves consensus on parity.\"\n}\n"
