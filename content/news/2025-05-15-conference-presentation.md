Our research team successfully presented groundbreaking findings at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ICAI 2025) held in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

## Presentation Highlights

Dr. Witold Bolt delivered a keynote presentation on "Scalable Machine Learning Architectures for Edge Computing," which received outstanding feedback from the international research community.

### Key Contributions

- Novel approach to distributed learning on resource-constrained devices
- 40% improvement in inference speed compared to existing methods
- Real-world validation in IoT sensor networks

## Conference Impact

The presentation attracted significant interest from both academic researchers and industry representatives. We have already received several collaboration proposals and invitations to present at other venues.

## Publications

The full research paper will be published in the conference proceedings and will be available on our [Publications](/publications/) page soon.
