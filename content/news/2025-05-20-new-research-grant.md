We are excited to announce that our research group has been awarded a prestigious â‚¬2.5 million grant from the European Research Council (ERC) to advance our work in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Project Overview

The three-year project, titled "Advanced Neural Architectures for Real-World Applications," will focus on developing novel deep learning methodologies that can be applied to complex real-world problems in healthcare, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring.

## Research Goals

- Develop more efficient neural network architectures
- Create robust AI systems for critical applications
- Establish new benchmarks for AI performance evaluation
- Foster international collaboration in AI research

## Team Expansion

This grant will allow us to expand our team by hiring 3 PhD students and 2 postdoctoral researchers. We will be announcing these positions in the coming weeks.
